- Added libraries needed by Semantag (Niko, 28.8.)

Niko (24-Aug-2004):

- CVS Import to sourceforge

- the base package is now: org.semantag

- Refactored package structure to separate tests into own substructure
  under src/test, this allows easily to distinguish between production
  and test code

- Clean-Up before first time importing to new CVS repository at SF.net
